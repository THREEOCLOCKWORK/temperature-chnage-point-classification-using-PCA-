# how to classify temperature points in a plane while its cordinates representing a cartesian sphere


Classification of points when ever there is a change in the temperature is detected 


Principle component analysis is done on the data where data is represnd in terms of angle of inclination

This inclination of the angles is then differntiated and the points are itself given as an input principle componenet anaysis which classify out data to our targets.


Priciple componet annalysis : what it does is itself taking the data into a whole diferent world where the data pints are projected as unit vector points with directions pointing perpendicular to the surface.
